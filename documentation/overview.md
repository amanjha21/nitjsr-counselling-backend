        >center incharge
        >verifying officer





A student will open the application and need to first register himself/herself. Then filling form of counselling, uploading necessary documents and filling the choice of Institute preferance in decreasing order . After submitting , correction of form date(if a student think that he/she has missed something or has filled incorrect information) will also be given by the institute .

Now its time to apply the core logic of alloting Institute to the students in various phases,in which the student has following decisions to take.

  1>freeze
  2>float
  3>reject


Freeze->Freezing a seat means you are happy with the institute  allocated, and you do not want to participate in further rounds.


Float->Floating means you will accept the seat but will wait if a better seat (in any institute) is offered in subsequent rounds. If not then you can go back to previously alloted seat.

Reject->You reject the process and is opting out from furthur rounds.



>ABOUT NIMCET 2022
National Institutes of Technology (NITs) are Institutes of National Importance and
are Centrally Funded Technical Institutes. The NIT MCA Common Entrance Test
(NIMCET), is a National Level Test conducted by NITs for admission to their Master
of Computer Applications (MCA) programme. The admission to the MCA
programme to the nine NITs at Agartala, Allahabad, Bhopal, Jamshedpur,
Kurukshetra, Raipur, Surathkal, Tiruchirappalli (Trichy), and Warangal for the year
2022-23 is based on the Rank obtained in NIMCET-2022 only. The Curriculum and
Syllabi of Master of Computer Applications (MCA) programme offered by NITs
are designed considering the needs of different Information Technology firms in
India and abroad. MCA graduates have high potential for jobs in the IT Sector.





>>>>libraries and frameworks used in this application ->

Node Js ->  Node.js is an open-source and cross-platform JavaScript runtime environment. It is a popular tool for almost any kind of project!
Node.js runs the V8 JavaScript engine, the core of Google Chrome, outside of the browser. This allows Node.js to be very performant.
A Node.js app runs in a single process, without creating a new thread for every request. Node.js provides a set of asynchronous I/O primitives in its standard library that prevent JavaScript code from blocking and generally, libraries in Node.js are written using non-blocking paradigms, making blocking behavior the exception rather than the norm.



Express Js->Express is a minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework that provides a robust set of features for web and mobile applications.The Express philosophy is to provide small, robust tooling for HTTP servers, making it a great solution for single page applications, websites, hybrids, or public HTTP APIs.


trycourier/courier-> Courier makes it easy to deliver the product notification experience your customers expect. Support all channels and use cases in a single API, and never worry about building your own notification infrastructure again.


axios-> Axios is a promise-based HTTP Client for node.js and the browser. It is isomorphic (= it can run in the browser and nodejs with the same codebase). On the server-side it uses the native node.js http module, while on the client (browser) it uses XMLHttpRequests.


bcryptjs-> The bcrypt NPM package is a JavaScript implementation of the bcrypt password hashing function that allows you to easily create a hash out of a password string . Unlike encryption which you can decode to get back the original password, hashing is a one-way function that can't be reversed once done.


compression-> Compression in Node. js and Express decreases the downloadable amount of data that's served to users. Through the use of this compression, we can improve the performance of our Node. js applications as our payload size is reduced drastically. There are two methods of compression.


cors-> Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) is an HTTP-header based mechanism that allows a server to indicate any origins (domain, scheme, or port) other than its own from which a browser should permit loading resources.


dotenv->DotEnv is a lightweight npm package that automatically loads environment variables from a . env file into the process. env object.

form-data-> A library to create readable "multipart/form-data" streams. Can be used to submit forms and file uploads to other web applications.

helmet-> Helmet.js is a Node.js module that helps in securing HTTP headers. It is implemented in express applications. Therefore, we can say that helmet.js helps in securing express applications. It sets up various HTTP headers to prevent attacks like Cross-Site-Scripting(XSS), clickjacking, etc.


jsonwebtoken->JSON Web Token (JWT) is an open standard (RFC 7519) that defines a compact and self-contained way for securely transmitting information between parties as a JSON object. This information can be verified and trusted because it is digitally signed. JWTs can be signed using a secret (with the HMAC algorithm) or a public/private key pair using RSA or ECDSA.


multer-> Multer is a node. js middleware for handling multipart/form-data , which is primarily used for uploading files. It is written on top of busboy for maximum efficiency. NOTE: Multer will not process any form which is not multipart ( multipart/form-data ).



puppeteer-> Puppeteer is a Node library which provides a high-level API to control headless Chrome or Chromium over the DevTools Protocol. It can also be configured to use full (non-headless) Chrome or Chromium.



sharp-> Puppeteer is a Node library which provides a high-level API to control headless Chrome or Chromium over the DevTools Protocol. It can also be configured to use full (non-headless) Chrome or Chromium.



nodemailer-> Nodemailer is a Node. js module that allows you to send emails from your server with ease. Whether you want to communicate with your users or just notify yourself when something has gone wrong, one of the options for doing so is through mail.
